# Pex Technical Challenge

## Description
Concatenate all strings for each object key and separate each string with a dot ('.'). Remove duplicate values (error messages) and flatten the object's nested structure. Do not keep the object's nested structure unless specified by the data within the deepEqual function. Only use functional programming, pure functions, and function arguments to complete the challenge.

## Technologies Used
- Node
- Immutable.js
- Mocha (to run tests)

## Getting Started
1. Download the zip file from [here](https://github.com/MilcahHalili/pex).
2. Unzip file.
3. In terminal, type:
`mkdir *yourDirectoryName* && cd *yourDirectoryName*`
4. Copy unzipped file to your newly-created directory.
5. In terminal, confirm that you have the minimum node version installed by typing:
`node -v`
`v8.4.0`
6. If you have installed Node, then type the following in *youDirectoryName*:
`npm init`
7. If you haven't installed Immutable or Mocha, then type:
`npm install immutable npm install mocha`
or
`npm i immutable npm i mocha`
